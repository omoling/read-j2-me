**NOTE**
This project has been developed during a university-coursework and, as the course has been passed ;) , development has been temporarily - we will see - stopped.

**GOAL**
Read-j2-me (or ReadJ2ME ) allows users to subscribe to ATOM news feeds using the a Java Mobile ( J2ME ) enabled mobile phone. In more detail, the application allows the user to subscribe to news feeds, remove a subscribed feed and browse a subscribed feed. When browsing a feed, the user is able to search the news items by a string in the title.
The user has the possibility to tag news items with one or more tags that can be defined and allow a search by tag.
In addition, application settings may be saved and automatically loaded at the next start-up of the
application, as i.e. the maximum number of news items that should be stored by each saved feed.
Tagged news items are prevented from automatic deletion when an update is performed.

In summary, these are the functionalities:
  * subscribe to a new feed
  * delete a feed's subscription
  * update a feed's news items
  * delete a news item
  * mark news items as unread
  * manage tags
  * tag news items
  * configure number of news items

_Note:_ the application was taught to mark unread news items in bold, but, as it has been developed using the 2.5.2 emulator version, this has a bug when changing the formatting of a list's entries, so the bold-formatting was removed: http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=160403&page=2 .
